### **Key Features**

Data Fetching and Display:

The Onebox component fetches email data from an API endpoint (/onebox/list) and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Users can see a list of emails, including details like sender, subject, and a brief preview of the content.

Keyboard Shortcuts:

Keyboard shortcuts enhance user interaction and efficiency. For example, pressing "D" deletes a selected email thread, and pressing "R" opens the reply box for the selected email. These shortcuts are implemented using event listeners in the component.

Custom Text Editor:

A custom text editor is embedded within the Onebox component, allowing users to compose and format replies. It includes custom buttons like "SAVE" and "Variables" that enable users to save drafts or insert predefined variables into the email body.

Light and Dark Mode Support:

The Onebox component supports both light and dark themes, allowing users to switch between modes based on their preferences. This feature ensures a better user experience across different environments and lighting conditions.
